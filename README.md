# Ruth-Oni-Portfolio

Welcome to the gateway to some academically and personally motivated projects I have worked on spanning Data science tasks including statistical analysis and modeling, ML tasks including computer vision, Natural Language Processing, and other Supervised learning tasks. There's some experimentation with Statistical models, traditional ML algorithms as well as Neural networks.

All repos include notebooks written mostly in python and reports. 

Before AI and Data Science, I am a Geographic Information systems analyst, and my interests are mainly to harmonize my passion in both areas and contribute to development that is sustainable regardless of the Industry.

## Running Python Notebooks Locally
****
- Install dependencies as listed in repo readme.
- I recommend running notebooks on a local jupyter notebook server or in Google Colab

## Projects
****
### Exploratory Data Analysis and Statistical Modeling
- [Road Accidents Analysis UK 2019](https://github.com/Onikenny/UK_Road_Traffic_Accidents-2019): This project investigates specific crash trends on small scales, including weekly and across days, the relationship between different data features and the rate of crash incidences in the UK in 2019. Predictive models are also developed to forecast the potential time, location and severity of accident and the results are compared with government baselines.
- [Census Project](https://github.com/Onikenny/Census-Project): This project aims to generate, analyze and model statistical data to make decisions about infrastructural development and allocate investment funding for a UK town based on the 1991 Census.
- [Customer Data Preprocessing](https://github.com/Onikenny/Customer-Data-Preprocessing): This project is the processing of data from a company's customer records for business purposes. The task is to prepare the data for further analysis by including representation changes, filtering, and deriving some new attributes / metrics for them.
- [Bitcoin price Forecasting with ARIMA time series](https://github.com/Onikenny/ARIMA-Time-Series-Bitcoin-forecasting): This project implements and evaluates an Arima Model for Bitcoin price prediction based on a real data from 2018.

### Machine Learning

##### Deep Learning
1. Computer Vision
   - [Multiple Object Recognizer](https://github.com/Onikenny/Multiple-Object-Recognizer): A Convolutional Neural Network is adapted to recognise the 4 vehicle types in a dataset. This project is a probe into the performance of convolution models trained from scratch and the factors that affect their performance.
2. Artificial Neural Networks 
   - [Water Quality Analysis](https://github.com/Onikenny/Water-Quality-Analysis): A model based on an Artificial Neural network is developed to classify drainages in UK Local Authorities to be above the biotixin treshold or not. The data is first manipulated to enable analysis. The project aims to assess various factors that affect the performance of Artificial neural networks using the dataset as a case study.
3. Recurrent Neural Networks 
   - [Deep Learning based sentiment analysis](): In progress
   
##### Supervised ML
1. Classification
   - [Clients Subscription](https://github.com/Onikenny/clients-subscription-model):This project adapts a classifier to predict which clients of a telecom company will subscribe to a new financial product.
